            <td>Background: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations members in 2015, created 17 world Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It was also accepted that these SDGs are not possible to achieve without changing humanity’s relationship with the oceans. To realize that, in 2017, it was decided that the decade of 2021-30 is to be observed as UN Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development (or UN Ocean Decade). INCOIS is identified as UN Ocean Decade Collaborative Centre for the Indian Ocean Region to help address all the ten UN Ocean Decade challenges (https://oceandecade.org/challenges/). Description: The creative solution proposed herein will address mainly (but not limited to) challenge-10. The gamified way of creating ocean related awareness is aimed for all age-groups and diverse education levels. Considering popularity of online gaming (multi-role playing to conventional games such as ludo) and affordable devices along with data plans, this approach is promising option for ocean literacy. For a starter, one such solution (but very limited/basic in nature) can be found at: https://www.outreachgames.org/OceanProtector/main.html. Expected Solution: The user will be able to chose from a variety of sea-going roles e.g. but not limited to, fishermen, captain of a ship, tourism operator etc. Based on the role, one needs to choose the correct sea conditions to be at a location (or move away) with the help of available/applicable ocean information services form INCOIS (simulated for the game). Correct decision (e.g. going for fishing to PFZ zone or moving away from the shore when tsunami is detected) will add to the points and help player achieve next level. Wrong decision may result in loosing points and add other gaming penalties (e.g. start over or wait till certain time etc etc). Users goal would be to advance and maintain gains at the daily, weekly etc leaderboards so in that way it would be competitive among the users even though their game decisions are not affecting to the others directly. The solution should be suitable for windows and android environments (web and browser based) and scalable over the time by the host institute independently post-SIH.</td>

            <td>1. Background. UIDAI is exploring possibilities to enable Face authentication on the desktop in a browser context. The proposed architecture to provide Face Authentication in the browser context,requires AI on the edge to perform liveness check of the face being captured by the webcam or connected camera. UIDAI is considering the injection of ML model by using an appropriate binary code delivery mechanism. The security of these models is important for transaction integrity and therefore seeking an innovative solution that will protect the model from any tampering and reverse engineering. 2. Problem Description. As part of the challenge, participating teams to demonstrate model security in a browser context by using either obfuscation or cryptography. Models are typically 5~7Mb in size and structured as flatbuffers. These models would be downloaded, when for the first time accessed on a desktop and then cached in the browser context. For subsequent face authentication transactions, a cached model would be preferred, unless otherwise the model has changed or updated. To solve the above problem statement, teams are free to choose either ONNX web runtime or Tensor.js or any other innovative model to distribute the model in the browser context. The proposed solution must meet the following functional objectives. 1 Model Security. The solution must provide a mechanism to protect the model from any reverse engineering or tampering. 2 Model Size Optimisation. The solution must not significantly increase the size of the model post-implementation of security frameworks. Models are expected to be downloaded in 3G/4G/5G wireless networks and hence any increase in size may lead to deteriorated user experience. 3 The solution must feature backend components to prepare the ML model either using obfuscation or cryptography. The backend activity can be a one-time task during the release of the ML models or a just-in-time approach. In the just-in-time approach, the model would be obfuscated or encrypted before being downloaded to the end user’s desktop. 3. Expected Solution. The expected outcome of this project is a functional solution that incorporates the security of the ML model at the edge. The backend for the proposed solution system must be designed to handle the high volume of transactions that is expected for any population-scale solutions.</td>

            <td>Background: The impact of oil spills at sea is multifaceted, affecting the environment, economy, public health, and society at large. Preventing spills through stringent regulations, improved technology, and better safety practices is crucial to mitigate these devastating effects. Automatic oil spill detection using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and satellite datasets is essential for environmental protection, public health and safety, economic stability, regulatory enforcement, technological advancement, and operational efficiency. This approach enables timely and effective responses to oil spills, mitigating their impact and promoting sustainable maritime practices. Integrating AIS and satellite datasets significantly enhances the early detection of oil spills at sea by combining real-time vessel tracking with advanced remote sensing capabilities. Detailed description: The automatic identification of oil leaks and spills from ships and vessels using AIS (Automatic Identification System) and satellite datasets involves integrating real-time tracking and advanced remote sensing technologies to monitor marine environments effectively. AIS provides crucial information such as the vessel&#x27;s unique identifiers (IMO number, call sign), real-time positional data (latitude, longitude), speed over ground (SOG), course over ground (COG), heading, type of vessel, dimensions, draught, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and cargo details. To detect a vessel in distress, AIS data have to be monitored for anomalies, such as sudden changes in speed or course, erratic movements, or unexpected stops. These irregularities can signal potential distress, prompting further investigation. Once detecting the distress, the same location/vessel have to be monitored using space borne satellite datasets for oil leaks, orientation of the vessel and its change in datum. The integration of AIS data with satellite datasets, enhances the ability to detect oil leaks early and can respond to situations efficiently. As far as study area, any of the below options may be considered.

            <td>Background: Easy to use and secure redaction tool “RE-DACT” which allows redaction/masking/anonymization on various input formats based on a gradational scale defined by the user and providing customized output. Over a time, model will learn and have the ability to generate realistic synthetic data in any sought format. Description: The proposed solution is a natural language processing (machine learning) based redaction tool. The tool will redact or obfuscate from original data leaving the output structurally/logically the same but stripped of key identifiers and other content which may in any way allow the identity, actual data, markers or issues in the input content to be revealed. The correlational logic may be appropriately obfuscated based on the degree of redaction. This will have an easy to use GUI and will be available for use on online and offline systems. The degree of the redaction will be up to the user- the higher the degree set by the user, the more the degree of redaction. This will work with all different commonly used formats for text and data sets. Security of data will be assured by ensuring that the input data is not stored or retrievable in any fashion by third party entities. User will have complete control over the input data. It is also an important aspect that sometimes data may be required to be stored or submitted, however specific sensitive details may not necessarily be required. In such a situation- anonymized data authenticated as having being redacted from original would suffice. Declassification processes are long and arduous; anonymization is largely manual or custom script driven. By providing a gradational redaction option, ordinary users can strip away the specificity to the extent of liking-from merely name removal/anonymization to completely synthetic data with only faint traces of original structure/pattern. This can allow generation of large number of databases with realistic but anonymized data that can be shared for learning, growth and commercial ventures. Expected Solution: Problem Statement: Easy to use and secure redaction tool “RE-DACT” which allows redaction/masking/anonymization on various input formats based on a gradational scale defined by the user and providing customized output. Over a time, model will learn and have the ability to generate realistic synthetic data in any sought format. Stage 1 Data: Curate and use own data set for building PoC Task/Result: Input/Output: Supports common input formats (text files, images) and basic output formats (redacted files, logs). Web based version Training Dataset: Publicly available dataset can be used for the purpose. Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score on Open Source Testing dataset. Stage 2 Data: Dataset will be provided in Grand Finale Task/Result: Input/Output: Expands to handle more data formats (e.g., PDFs, videos) and advanced output options (e.g., redacted versions with annotations). Training Dataset: Diverse data set prepared from commonly used formats Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score on Open Source Testing dataset. Performance/Evaluation Criteria: • PoC will be preferred over just concept or presentation. The performance may be ascertained on the following metrics: • Efficacy of the redaction/anonymization- whether appropriate data has been redacted • Gradational effect achieved based on user preference and ability to calibrate. • Ability to work on a variety of input sources • Security of the input data by minimal retention • Speed • Optimized computing usage and ability to operate at scale. • Ease of use, UI, UX. • Performance benchmarked against COTS solutions. • Web Based and Offline solution. • Minimal API dependency • Use of Secure Coding Practices and cybersecurity built in design.</td>

At Ajmer, 20 % of the volume is offloaded, and 30% loaded, bringing total loading to 90% capacity (80-20+30 = 90). Similarly, at Jaipur, 40% volume is offloaded and 50 % loaded, bringing total loading to 100% (90-40+50= 100)]. Real time data is required for optimal utilization of truck capacity and adequate planning. In order to monetize spare capacity, integration with 3PL partners for capacity sharing through API (as described in the previous point) is also required. RTN trucks traverse a fixed route with specific touch points. The trucks may be delayed due to various factors, such as vehicle breakdown, poor traffic conditions, detours, detention at one or more touch points etc. GPS, geofenced locking should be enabled for any detours or delays so that alerts may immediately be triggered for verification and corrective action in time. Live tracking of trucks, with points of delay is required for efficient and timely movement of parcels and mail in the value chain. There should be a system for dispatch and schedule management as per live data automatically populated and analyzed in real time. Any changes or deviations should automatically flow into the system so that schedules, which are downstream, automatically get updated and adjusted to the delay in real time. All data should be captured and populated automatically, and relevant MIS reports generated automatically with visualization where relevant. Expected Solution: As described above the expected solution is based of GPS leading to a strong GIS for the network for it to send alerts and prompt necessary adjustments on the interlinked parts of the supply chain for every run of the truck.</td>

            <td>Background: Department of Posts (DoP) covers around 219 countries where a large diaspora of India in different economic capacities exists. PIOs still take/use Indian Products such as Puja Samagri/Traditional Attires/ Handicrafts. Most of them are dependent on e-commerce platform. Through this they cannot be assured of the quality of the products they get and transportation cost may also be very high. Secondly local sellers/small handicrafts artisans who are the actual manufacturers are not able to ship high quality products because of limited resources and information at their disposal. Hence there is a need to connect the Indian Community abroad with the local artisans. Description: In order to overcome this issue an application is required through which one can go to a particular local seller as per their preference and should be able to onboard the seller as well. The following data points may be required to be integrated in the said Application. 1. Global Indian Diaspora Data on the basis of their needs namely – Income/ Financial data, Consumption pattern and buying behavior pattern. 2. There should be Buyer and Seller Registration so that Quality Assurance and standard Transit Cost can be ensured. 3. Product and customer segments identification of target population, this includes utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) so that specific needs can be assessed like Puja Samagri of Kumartuli, Handicrafts of Santiniketan, Moya of Joynagar (famous sweets), Terracotta Arts of Bishnupur, etc. 4. Special preference should be given on keeping in the mind of Seasonal needs, Traditional Attires for Wedding ceremony, Festival needs as this varies geographically depending upon Special Socio Economic Culture. 5. A range of products which are prepared (by MSME and others ) in the different parts of India , which can match the buying needs of global diaspora. So that a global link through Postal Export may be created towards fulfillment of needs. Therefore, it is about bringing the Diaspora close to India and remains emotionally connected to their roots.</td>

The Post Office also merges Pincodes together to mechanise and streamline delivery in the emerging volume and mix of mail handled at different stages, including the point of delivery. An intelligent solution, powered by AI is needed to meet the dynamic design of the supply chain both for customers as well as operators within India Post.</td>
            <td>Background: The Department of Post in India boasts the world&#x27;s largest postal network, with over 165,000 post offices. Through nearly 19,000 pin codes across the country the postal network manages the delivery of postal items across its network. One common issue is the mismatch between the specified Delivery Post Office name and the area PIN code on mail items, leading to delays and customer dissatisfaction.The delivery network design keeps on evolving as Nodal Delivery Centres and Delivery Hubs are introduced to bring in more efficiency in operations. From the perspective of the customer, the challenge is two fold: (a) to know the correct Pin Code, which is itself a challeng; (b) the dynamic nature of operations inside with merged pin codes etc for all or certain categories of mail is also a challenge. Though the customer does not need to bother about (b), the internal system of India Post needs to take care of both issues (a) and (b) for efficient and correct delivery at all times. Description: Postal services are essential for various government, financial, educational, corporate, and public entities, both in urban and rural areas. Despite the widespread use of postal services, inaccurate addressing persists, hampering efficient delivery. Each mail item must clearly indicate the recipient&#x27;s Delivery Post Office name and area Pin Code. However, inconsistencies in this information often result in misrouted mail, with approximately 5% of articles handled daily at distribution hubs containing incorrect Pin Codes. Even if correct Pincodes are provided as per information available with the customer, there is a mismatch in the internal operations as the constant upgradation of delivery network with Nodal Delivery Centres with merged pincodes etc makes it too dynamic for internal operators to keep pace with the changes. This leads to mistakes, delays and wasteful movement of mail pieces in the system. Expected Solution: An AI-based scanning solution is proposed to identify the correct delivery location for mail items with unclear or mismatched addresses. This system will utilize advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret address information, determining the appropriate Delivery Post Office based on available data. By automating the identification process, this solution aims to improve last-mile delivery efficiency, reducing delays and enhancing customer satisfaction. Having taken care of the first problem, the system is also expected to align with internal operational databases for clubbing and mapping of different pincodes for delivery purpose and thereby suggest the right destination for dispatch and delivery of the articles.</td>

With a focus on dynamic allocation and use of available transport within the structure of mail operations defined by the Department of Posts we need a system to help choose the best mode across land rail air and water for fastest transmission of mail in each local context. &quot;&quot;</td>
            <td>Background: India Post boasts the world&#x27;s largest postal network. However, ensuring the timely and accurate transmission of mail remains a significant challenge. Transmission of mails in the Department of Posts is done through its own Mail Motor Service and hired contractual Road Transport Network. Apart from that Postal Mail transmission is also heavily reliant on third party operators, viz., Railways, Flights, Ships, Helicopters etc. Few issues that hamper timely transmission are natural calamities, rescheduling or cancellation of flights / trains / ships / helicopters etc., security detention, Embargo, Road / Rail accidents, blockage etc. Description: Postal services are the backbone on written communication even today. In a country like India, that is heavily dependent on migrant workers and earning members of families living in far off places, parcels / gifts / medicines etc. sent through the postal network too play a vital role.In order to transmit all such mails in a streamlined way, and in a time-bound manner, methodical planning and utilizing all available transport channels in the most effective manner is of utmost importance. Expected Solution: 1. Predicting optimum mode of routing and transmission using the best available connectivity, considering real-time data and availability of space. 2. Mode of transmission that will be interactive with the transport agency. 3. The solution should also have interface for monitoring mail transmission, suggesting alternative routes, self-learn from previous situations to identify the fastest mode of transmission utilizing all available channels. 4. Alerts to the customer (both sender and addressee) may be sent conveying information about any changes/delay in normal transmission caused by any beyond-control situations.</td>

            <td>Background: The Department of Posts has implemented various Post Office Savings Bank (POSB) Schemes in All over India uniformly. However, each socio-geographic formation at the state, district, block and village level has its own demographic realities that require a customised thrust for making the relevant financial and insurance services available to the served population around each post office. For example, in West Bengal, there are some villages where percentage of females are higher where if Melas for Sukanya Samriddhi Accounts ( SSA) and Mahila Samriddhi Samman Patras (MSSC) can be arranged, the effectiveness of the sales effort and the conversion rate will be higher. Similarly, in some villages the number of senior citizens are higher and higher number of Senior Citizen Social Security (SCSS) accounts can be opened for their benefit to justify presence of post offices in these areas. But there is no such report from where it can be identified, where and when the need of which product is higher. All melas like SSA, MSSC, Postal Life Insurance (PLI) , Rural Postal Life Insurance ( RPLI) have been arranged in villages without the knowledge of percentage of male/female/child and senior citizens resulting in moderate to mediocre success for the efforts. Description: The Department of Posts has implemented various POSB Schemes in All over India uniformly. Actual demographic location-wise population is to be identified. In West Bengal, for example, there are some villages where percentage of females are higher, in some villages the number of senior citizens are higher. In some sectors demand young generation and service holders are much higher. The need of the youth and service holders are very different from the demands of other sector of people. Density of farmers and business-oriented people are higher in some areas. All melas like SSA, MSSC, Public Provident Fund (PPF), Recurring Deposits (RD), Time Deposit ( TD) PLI, RPLI have been arranged in every city and villages without the knowledge of percentage of male/female/child/senior citizens and other sectors of people and as a result the success of all the melas are found not satisfactory. Expected Solution: The expected solution is pictorial data and actual demographic and economic location-wise population is to be identified. The demographic and location-wise population data is to be taken as a fundamental data towards improvement of financial (banking &amp; insurance) services.</td>

E-commerce organisations like Amazon,Flipkart, financial organisations like ICICI, HDFC etc are providing door step products/services with use of advanced technology like digital platform or machine learning through AI. This creates another level of acceptance across the world among the recipient for the organisation. This is becoming part of basic customer expectation and needs to be included in the Department’s common value proposition with the help of a robust system tied to its operational system. Description: India Post as the largest mail delivery organisation in India delivers articles/parcels at the door step of customer. The delivery is one of the key services the Department offers to the citizens of India. Department reaches last mile of delivery through its branches. The delivery process initiates at the booking Post office after receiving mails/articles. After sorting, the concerned Postman of the delivery Post Office has to reach to the recipient for delivering article mostly during the office hours, i.e. in between 10am to 5pm. In many instances, recipient cannot receive the article within that time range of the delivery due to his absence at the delivery address. In that case i) Post man either has to make 2nd attempt or next day delivery which falls within same time range orii) after unsuccessful delivery Postman has to serve intimation for next day delivery or for window delivery at Post Office by the recipient personally. In both cases, wastage of valuable working hours of the Postman happens for sure. Moreover, due to such incident, recipient has to take leave from his/her work as delivery time range/slot gets coincided with his/her working hours for collecting the article. In many cases article gets returned to sender because of non-availability of the addressee within time range of Postman delivery. This creates dissatisfaction on the delivery service among both Sender and Receiver of the article/consignment, thus lowering departmental performance index. Hence Department is losing the extra mile of delivery performance in the eye of customer of modern era as well as e-commerce like product oriented organizations who uses last mile unique delivery system of this organisation. Expected Solution: - At time of booking of any consignment sender should have option to select time slot for delivery and share the same with the recipient which can be modified by the sender online at any point of time before the date of delivery. Whenever recipient will receive sms/alert about the consignment to be delivered at his/her end with the mentioned time slot, the recipient should have the option/flexibility to make change of time slot online before the day of delivery. Initially such data will create training data for AI which will develop a reference frame of time slot for sender and also for delivery person of department for timely and customer friendly future delivery of article for same recipient. Last mile of delivery information will become integral part of booking which will help both consignment movement across the country and effective delivery.</td>

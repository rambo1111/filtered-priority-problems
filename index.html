            <td>Background: The impact of oil spills at sea is multifaceted, affecting the environment, economy, public health, and society at large. Preventing spills through stringent regulations, improved technology, and better safety practices is crucial to mitigate these devastating effects. Automatic oil spill detection using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and satellite datasets is essential for environmental protection, public health and safety, economic stability, regulatory enforcement, technological advancement, and operational efficiency. This approach enables timely and effective responses to oil spills, mitigating their impact and promoting sustainable maritime practices. Integrating AIS and satellite datasets significantly enhances the early detection of oil spills at sea by combining real-time vessel tracking with advanced remote sensing capabilities. Detailed description: The automatic identification of oil leaks and spills from ships and vessels using AIS (Automatic Identification System) and satellite datasets involves integrating real-time tracking and advanced remote sensing technologies to monitor marine environments effectively. AIS provides crucial information such as the vessel&#x27;s unique identifiers (IMO number, call sign), real-time positional data (latitude, longitude), speed over ground (SOG), course over ground (COG), heading, type of vessel, dimensions, draught, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and cargo details. To detect a vessel in distress, AIS data have to be monitored for anomalies, such as sudden changes in speed or course, erratic movements, or unexpected stops. These irregularities can signal potential distress, prompting further investigation. Once detecting the distress, the same location/vessel have to be monitored using space borne satellite datasets for oil leaks, orientation of the vessel and its change in datum. The integration of AIS data with satellite datasets, enhances the ability to detect oil leaks early and can respond to situations efficiently. As far as study area, any of the below options may be considered.

            <td>Background: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations members in 2015, created 17 world Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It was also accepted that these SDGs are not possible to achieve without changing humanity’s relationship with the oceans. To realize that, in 2017, it was decided that the decade of 2021-30 is to be observed as UN Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development (or UN Ocean Decade). INCOIS is identified as UN Ocean Decade Collaborative Centre for the Indian Ocean Region to help address all the ten UN Ocean Decade challenges (https://oceandecade.org/challenges/). Description: The creative solution proposed herein will address mainly (but not limited to) challenge-10. The gamified way of creating ocean related awareness is aimed for all age-groups and diverse education levels. Considering popularity of online gaming (multi-role playing to conventional games such as ludo) and affordable devices along with data plans, this approach is promising option for ocean literacy. For a starter, one such solution (but very limited/basic in nature) can be found at: https://www.outreachgames.org/OceanProtector/main.html. Expected Solution: The user will be able to chose from a variety of sea-going roles e.g. but not limited to, fishermen, captain of a ship, tourism operator etc. Based on the role, one needs to choose the correct sea conditions to be at a location (or move away) with the help of available/applicable ocean information services form INCOIS (simulated for the game). Correct decision (e.g. going for fishing to PFZ zone or moving away from the shore when tsunami is detected) will add to the points and help player achieve next level. Wrong decision may result in loosing points and add other gaming penalties (e.g. start over or wait till certain time etc etc). Users goal would be to advance and maintain gains at the daily, weekly etc leaderboards so in that way it would be competitive among the users even though their game decisions are not affecting to the others directly. The solution should be suitable for windows and android environments (web and browser based) and scalable over the time by the host institute independently post-SIH.</td>

The proposed architecture to provide Face Authentication in the browser context,requires AI on the edge to perform liveness check of the face being captured by the webcam or connected camera. UIDAI is considering the injection of ML model by using an appropriate binary code delivery mechanism. The security of these models is important for transaction integrity and therefore seeking an innovative solution that will protect the model from any tampering and reverse engineering. 2. Problem Description. As part of the challenge, participating teams to demonstrate model security in a browser context by using either obfuscation or cryptography. Models are typically 5~7Mb in size and structured as flatbuffers. These models would be downloaded, when for the first time accessed on a desktop and then cached in the browser context. For subsequent face authentication transactions, a cached model would be preferred, unless otherwise the model has changed or updated. To solve the above problem statement, teams are free to choose either ONNX web runtime or Tensor.js or any other innovative model to distribute the model in the browser context. The proposed solution must meet the following functional objectives. 1 Model Security. The solution must provide a mechanism to protect the model from any reverse engineering or tampering. 2 Model Size Optimisation. The solution must not significantly increase the size of the model post-implementation of security frameworks. Models are expected to be downloaded in 3G/4G/5G wireless networks and hence any increase in size may lead to deteriorated user experience. 3 The solution must feature backend components to prepare the ML model either using obfuscation or cryptography. The backend activity can be a one-time task during the release of the ML models or a just-in-time approach. In the just-in-time approach, the model would be obfuscated or encrypted before being downloaded to the end user’s desktop. 3. Expected Solution. The expected outcome of this project is a functional solution that incorporates the security of the ML model at the edge. The backend for the proposed solution system must be designed to handle the high volume of transactions that is expected for any population-scale solutions.</td>

The correlational logic may be appropriately obfuscated based on the degree of redaction. This will have an easy to use GUI and will be available for use on online and offline systems. The degree of the redaction will be up to the user- the higher the degree set by the user, the more the degree of redaction. This will work with all different commonly used formats for text and data sets. Security of data will be assured by ensuring that the input data is not stored or retrievable in any fashion by third party entities. User will have complete control over the input data. It is also an important aspect that sometimes data may be required to be stored or submitted, however specific sensitive details may not necessarily be required. In such a situation- anonymized data authenticated as having being redacted from original would suffice. Declassification processes are long and arduous; anonymization is largely manual or custom script driven. By providing a gradational redaction option, ordinary users can strip away the specificity to the extent of liking-from merely name removal/anonymization to completely synthetic data with only faint traces of original structure/pattern. This can allow generation of large number of databases with realistic but anonymized data that can be shared for learning, growth and commercial ventures. Expected Solution: Problem Statement: Easy to use and secure redaction tool “RE-DACT” which allows redaction/masking/anonymization on various input formats based on a gradational scale defined by the user and providing customized output. Over a time, model will learn and have the ability to generate realistic synthetic data in any sought format. Stage 1 Data: Curate and use own data set for building PoC Task/Result: Input/Output: Supports common input formats (text files, images) and basic output formats (redacted files, logs). Web based version Training Dataset: Publicly available dataset can be used for the purpose. Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score on Open Source Testing dataset. Stage 2 Data: Dataset will be provided in Grand Finale Task/Result: Input/Output: Expands to handle more data formats (e.g., PDFs, videos) and advanced output options (e.g., redacted versions with annotations). Training Dataset: Diverse data set prepared from commonly used formats Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score on Open Source Testing dataset. Performance/Evaluation Criteria: • PoC will be preferred over just concept or presentation. The performance may be ascertained on the following metrics: • Efficacy of the redaction/anonymization- whether appropriate data has been redacted • Gradational effect achieved based on user preference and ability to calibrate. • Ability to work on a variety of input sources • Security of the input data by minimal retention • Speed • Optimized computing usage and ability to operate at scale. • Ease of use, UI, UX. • Performance benchmarked against COTS solutions. • Web Based and Offline solution. • Minimal API dependency • Use of Secure Coding Practices and cybersecurity built in design.</td>

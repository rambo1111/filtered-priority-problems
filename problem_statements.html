            <td>Detecting oil spills at marine environment using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and satellite datasets</td>
            <td>Background: The impact of oil spills at sea is multifaceted, affecting the environment, economy, public health, and society at large. Preventing spills through stringent regulations, improved technology, and better safety practices is crucial to mitigate these devastating effects. Automatic oil spill detection using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and satellite datasets is essential for environmental protection, public health and safety, economic stability, regulatory enforcement, technological advancement, and operational efficiency. This approach enables timely and effective responses to oil spills, mitigating their impact and promoting sustainable maritime practices. Integrating AIS and satellite datasets significantly enhances the early detection of oil spills at sea by combining real-time vessel tracking with advanced remote sensing capabilities. Detailed description: The automatic identification of oil leaks and spills from ships and vessels using AIS (Automatic Identification System) and satellite datasets involves integrating real-time tracking and advanced remote sensing technologies to monitor marine environments effectively. AIS provides crucial information such as the vessel&#x27;s unique identifiers (IMO number, call sign), real-time positional data (latitude, longitude), speed over ground (SOG), course over ground (COG), heading, type of vessel, dimensions, draught, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and cargo details. To detect a vessel in distress, AIS data have to be monitored for anomalies, such as sudden changes in speed or course, erratic movements, or unexpected stops. These irregularities can signal potential distress, prompting further investigation. Once detecting the distress, the same location/vessel have to be monitored using space borne satellite datasets for oil leaks, orientation of the vessel and its change in datum. The integration of AIS data with satellite datasets, enhances the ability to detect oil leaks early and can respond to situations efficiently. As far as study area, any of the below options may be considered.

The tool/system should detect the anomalies in AIS around the vessel. The distress/anomaly zone has to be monitored for oil spills using Satellite datasets. This can help in early detection of oil leak from a ship or vessel. The information can be passed on to the regulatory authorities for quicker and efficient response.</td>

            <td>RE-DACT</td>
            <td>Background: Easy to use and secure redaction tool “RE-DACT” which allows redaction/masking/anonymization on various input formats based on a gradational scale defined by the user and providing customized output. Over a time, model will learn and have the ability to generate realistic synthetic data in any sought format. Description: The proposed solution is a natural language processing (machine learning) based redaction tool. The tool will redact or obfuscate from original data leaving the output structurally/logically the same but stripped of key identifiers and other content which may in any way allow the identity, actual data, markers or issues in the input content to be revealed. The correlational logic may be appropriately obfuscated based on the degree of redaction. This will have an easy to use GUI and will be available for use on online and offline systems. The degree of the redaction will be up to the user- the higher the degree set by the user, the more the degree of redaction. This will work with all different commonly used formats for text and data sets. Security of data will be assured by ensuring that the input data is not stored or retrievable in any fashion by third party entities. User will have complete control over the input data. It is also an important aspect that sometimes data may be required to be stored or submitted, however specific sensitive details may not necessarily be required. In such a situation- anonymized data authenticated as having being redacted from original would suffice. Declassification processes are long and arduous; anonymization is largely manual or custom script driven. By providing a gradational redaction option, ordinary users can strip away the specificity to the extent of liking-from merely name removal/anonymization to completely synthetic data with only faint traces of original structure/pattern. This can allow generation of large number of databases with realistic but anonymized data that can be shared for learning, growth and commercial ventures. Expected Solution: Problem Statement: Easy to use and secure redaction tool “RE-DACT” which allows redaction/masking/anonymization on various input formats based on a gradational scale defined by the user and providing customized output. Over a time, model will learn and have the ability to generate realistic synthetic data in any sought format. Stage 1 Data: Curate and use own data set for building PoC Task/Result: Input/Output: Supports common input formats (text files, images) and basic output formats (redacted files, logs). Web based version Training Dataset: Publicly available dataset can be used for the purpose. Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score on Open Source Testing dataset. Stage 2 Data: Dataset will be provided in Grand Finale Task/Result: Input/Output: Expands to handle more data formats (e.g., PDFs, videos) and advanced output options (e.g., redacted versions with annotations). Training Dataset: Diverse data set prepared from commonly used formats Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score on Open Source Testing dataset. Performance/Evaluation Criteria: • PoC will be preferred over just concept or presentation. The performance may be ascertained on the following metrics: • Efficacy of the redaction/anonymization- whether appropriate data has been redacted • Gradational effect achieved based on user preference and ability to calibrate. • Ability to work on a variety of input sources • Security of the input data by minimal retention • Speed • Optimized computing usage and ability to operate at scale. • Ease of use, UI, UX. • Performance benchmarked against COTS solutions. • Web Based and Offline solution. • Minimal API dependency • Use of Secure Coding Practices and cybersecurity built in design.</td>
